* Omnivision OV9655 CMOS sensor

The Omnivision OV9655 sensor support multiple resolutions output, such as
CIF, SVGA, UXGA. It also can support YUV422/420, RGB565/555 or raw RGB
output format.

Required Properties:
- compatible: should be one of
	"ovti,ov9655"
- clocks: reference to the xclk input clock.

Optional Properties:
- resetb-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the RESETB pin, if any,
		polarity is active low.
- pwdn-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the PWDN pin, if any,
		polarity is active high.
- avdd-supply: reference to the analog power supply regulator connected
		to the AVDD pin, if any.
- dvdd-supply: reference to the digital power supply regulator connected
		to the DVDD pin, if any.
- dovdd-supply: reference to the digital I/O power supply regulator
		connected to the DOVDD pin, if any.


The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

&i2c2 {
	ov9655@30 {
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&camera_pins>;
		compatible = "ovti,ov9655";
		reg = <0x30>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio3 2 0>,	/* reset cam_fld = GPIO_98 */
		pwdn-gpios = <&gpio6 7 0>;	/* pwdn cam_wen = GPIO_167 */
		avdd-supply = <&vaux3>;
		clocks = <&isp 0>;	/* cam_clka */

		port {
			ov9655: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&parallel_ep>;
			};
		};
	};
};
