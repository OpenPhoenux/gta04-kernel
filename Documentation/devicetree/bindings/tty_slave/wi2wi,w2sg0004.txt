wi2wi GPS device

This is accessed via a serial port and is largely controlled via that
link.  Extra configuration is needed to enable power on/off

Required properties:
- compatible: "wi2wi,w2sg0004"
- gpios: gpios used to toggle 'on/off' pin
- interrupts: interrupt generated by RX pin when device
      should be off

Optional properties:
- vdd-supply: regulator used to power antenna
- pinctrl: "default", "off"
      if "off" setting is provided it is imposed when device should
      be off.  This can route the RX pin to a GPIO interrupt.

The w2sg0004 uses a pin-toggle both to power-on and to
power-off, so the driver needs to detect what state it is in.
It does this by detecting characters on the RX line.
When it should be off, these can optionally be detected by a GPIO.

The node for this device must be the child of a UART.

Example:
&uart2 {
       gps {
               compatible = "wi2iw,w2sg0004";
               vdd-supply = <&vsim>;
               gpios = <&gpio5 17 0>; /* GPIO_145 */
               interrupts-extended = <&gpio5 19 0>; /* GPIO_147 */
               /* When off, switch RX to be an interrupt */
               pinctrl-names = "default", "off";
               pinctrl-0 = <&uart2_pins>;
               pinctrl-1 = <&uart2_pins_rx_gpio>;
       };
};
