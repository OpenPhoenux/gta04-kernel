wi2wi bluetooth module

This is accessed via a serial port and is largely controlled via that
link.  Extra configuration is needed to enable power on/off

Required properties:
- compatible: "wi2wi,w2cbw003"
- vdd-supply: regulator used to power the device.

The node for this device must be the child of a UART.

Example:

&uart1 {
       bluetooth {
               compatible = "wi2wi,w2cbw003";
               vdd-supply = <&vaux4>;
       };
};
