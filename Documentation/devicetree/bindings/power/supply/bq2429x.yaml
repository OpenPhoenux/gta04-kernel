description: |+
  This binding will support the bq24296 and 297. It was derived
  from a bq24296 driver but is tested with bq24297 only.
  There are other ICs in the same family but those have
  not been tested.
  The MP2624 is very similar to the bq24297.

  TI bq24296/24297 Li-Ion Charger
  ===============================

  This binding will support the bq24297. It was derived
  from a bq24296 driver but is tested with bq24297 only.
  There are other ICs in the same family but those have
  not been tested. The Monolithic Power Systems mp2624
  is very similar to the bq24297.

  Required properties:
  - compatible: Should contain one of the following:
      * "ti,bq24296"
      * "ti,bq24297"
      * "mps,mp2624"
  - reg: integer, i2c address of the device (should be 0x6b).

  Optional properties:
  - monitored-battery: phandle of the battery
    properties used if defined:
    * voltage-max-design-microvolt (default 4200000)
    * voltage-min-design-microvolt (default 3200000)
    * constant-charge-current-max-microamp
    (default: as defined by boot loader)
    * precharge-current-microamp (default 128000)
    * charge-term-current-microamp (default 128000)
  - dc-det: gpio for detecting two different DC sources
    (default: use usb-input-current-microamp only)
  - ti,usb-input-current-microamp: default current for USB source
    (default: value as defined by boot loader)
  - ti,adp-input-current-microamp: default current for other source
    (default: 2048000)

  Required nodes:
  - regulators: child node defining exactly two regulators for
    [0] vsys (battery or usb input -> system output) and
    [1] otg (battery input -> usb output).
