Binding for TI bq24296/24297 Li-Ion Charger

This driver will support the bq24297. It was derived
from a bq2426 driver but is tested with bq24297 only.
There are other ICs in the same family but those have
not been tested.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain one of the following:
    * "ti,bq24296"
    * "ti,bq24297"
- reg: integer, i2c address of the device (should be 0x6b).
- ti,chg_current: 3 integers, maximum charging current (in uA):
	1. max current for the battery
	2. max. usb input current
	3. max. adp input current (unused)
- regulators: child node defining two regulators for
	1. vsys (battery or usb -> system output) and
	2. otg (battery -> usb).

Optional properties:
- monitored-battery: phandle of the battery;
- dc-det: gpio for dc detect (bq24296)

Example:

bq24297@6b {
	compatible = "ti,bq24297";
	reg = <0x6b>;
	monitored-battery = <&bat>;	// provides max-voltage-by-design
	ti,chg_current = <1000 2000 2000>;      // chg_current (max for the battery), usb_input_current, adp_input_current
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio99>;
	interrupts = <(1*8+3) IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;   // P13
	ti,watchdog = <40>;             // 40 seconds watchdog timer
	regulators {
		vsys_reg: vsys_regulator {
			regulator-compatible = "bq2429x-vsys";
			regulator-name = "vsys";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <3500000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <4200000>;
			regulator-always-on;
			regulator-boot-on;
		};
		otg_reg: otg_regulator {
			regulator-compatible = "bq2429x-otg";
			regulator-name = "otg";
			regulator-min-microvolt = <4900000>;
			regulator-max-microvolt = <5100000>;
		};
	};
};
