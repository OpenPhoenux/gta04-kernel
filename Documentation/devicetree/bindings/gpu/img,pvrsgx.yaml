description: |+
  This binding describes the Imagination SGX5 series of 3D accelerators which
  are found in several different SoC like TI OMAP, Sitara, Ingenic JZ4780,
  Allwinner A83, and Intel Poulsbo and CedarView and more.

  For an almost complete list see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerVR#Implementations
  
  Only the Imagination SGX530, SGX540 and SGX544 GPUs are currently covered by
  this binding but the extension of the pattern is straightforward.
  
  The SGX node is usually a child node of some DT node belonging to the SoC
  which handles clocks, reset and general address space mapping of the SGX
  register area.
