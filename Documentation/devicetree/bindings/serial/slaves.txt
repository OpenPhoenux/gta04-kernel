Device-Tree bindings for UART slave devices

A node describing a slave device defines a phandle to reference the UART
the device is connected to. In the (unexpected) case of two or more UARTs
a list of phandles can be specified.

properties:
	- uart: (list of) phandle(s) of UART(s) the device is connected to
	  if it is missing it defaults to a single parent node


examples:

	gps {
		compatible = "wi2wi,w2sg0004";
		uart = <&uart1>;
	};

	&uart2 {
		gps {
			compatible = "wi2wi,w2sg0004";
		};
	};
