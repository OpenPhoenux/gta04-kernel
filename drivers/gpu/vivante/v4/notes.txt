gckMATH_ModuloInt: can be inlined, is used only in two places
gcoDUMP: can be removed


All gco functions can go, these are userspace.
Same for gcm (not gcmk)

gc_hal_profiler_internal.h, except for one #define

TODO

- Don't need the profileFileName (VIVANTE_PROFILER) and profileEnabled on
  _gckKERNEL.

  Used only by commands gcvHAL_GET_PROFILE_SETTING and gcvHAL_SET_PROFILE_SETTING,
  for the user space to store the profiling name and status inside the kernel.

- Semaphores/queues: could simply use Linux built-in objects instead of an
  abstraction.

- gckOS_QueryNeedCopy: can be replaced by TRUE or FALSE based on NO_USER_DIRECT_ACCESS_FROM_KERNEL
  Inlined?
  Doesn't need any of the argument validation

- gcdNULL_DRIVER: not needed

- Commented out code (#if 0) in gckCOMMAND_Commit

        /* Determine context entry and exit points. */

Bugs?
---------

- Unnecessary check in context update
Line 1419 in gckCONTEXT_Update:    if (j >= Context->stateCount)
Why? Seems wrong.
  ("more updates than states" ok, can't be logical)


Optimization
----------------
Cache settings

- gcdNONPAGED_MEMORY_CACHEABLE
