	  Digital I/O support.

	  If you want MMC/SD/SDIO support, you should say Y here and
	  also to your specific host controller driver.

	help
	  If you say yes here you can use the txs02612 sd switch
	  and level shifter.
	  The driver is intended to finally provide transparent
	  use of both SD cards connected to a single host SD interface
	  but currently there is only a sysfs control to throw the
	  switch. Please eject the "drive" before toggling the switch.
